# Text Classification with BERT and Fine-Tuning 

# This project is part of a Text Mining course, where BERT is fine-tuned for classifying news articles from the AG News dataset to demonstrate its application in text classification tasks.



The project will evaluate the model's efficacy to baseline models and assess how well it can categorize articles from several categories (World, Sports, Business, and Science/Technology).
